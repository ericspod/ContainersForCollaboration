    "\n",
    "Dockerfiles are scripts for setting up an image. From a base image a new one is created by installing packages, copying files, and configuring the image as if it were a full Linux environment. This script is composed of a sequence of commands which are run in order, with Docker caching the state of the image between each one, allowing the developer to make changes without having to repeat unchanged steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most-used commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `FROM`: states the image to base the configuration on, `scratch` for a completely blank image.\n",
    "* `COPY`: copy file(s) into a location in the image.\n",
    "* `RUN`: run a command in the image, if given as a string command (eg. `RUN echo Hello run`) the command is run using `/bin/sh`, if in exec form (eg. `RUN [\"/bin/echo\",\"Hello run\"]`) this is run without shell invocation or interpretation. By default the command is run as root.\n",
    "* `ENV`: set an environment variable, either as `ENV key value...` or `ENV key=value, key=value, ...`.\n",
    "* `EXPOSE`: states that the nominated port number is meant to be exposed by the image when run but doesn't ensure this is the case.\n",
    "* `WORKDIR`: sets the working directory in the image of any subsequent commands.\n",
    "* `USER`: switch the user executing commands to the nominated username, which must already exist in the image\n",
    "* `ENTRYPOINT`: state the command to run when the container starts, this can be as a shell command (`ENTRYPOINT echo Hello run`) or exec command (`ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/echo\",\"Hello run\"]`). Arguments passed to the container in `docker run`, or those in the `CMD` command if none provided, are appended to the arguments of the command to run.\n",
    "* `CMD`: like `ENTRYPOINT` however if arguments are passed to `docker run` these must state a new executable to run as the command followed by its arguments. \n",
